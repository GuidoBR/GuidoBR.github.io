I've started studying Python (Pandas and Numpy on a Jupyter notebook) to learn finance and accounting. I think this can improve the way I invest
and manage my portfolio and help others do the same.

My notes on this subject will be shared here on this blog and at a [Jupyter notebook on my Github](https://github.com/GuidoBR/python-for-finance).
I've also started a
repository to download reports letters of great fund managers (Brazil and USA), you can help me out on [Investment-letters](https://github.com/GuidoBR/investment-letters).

Here are some resources that are helping me on this journey.
