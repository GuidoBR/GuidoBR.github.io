I am a Linux user since early 2008, with the Ubuntu 8.04. I fell in love with it, a nice desktop interface,
less security problems and headaches, and what for me is the most important thing: more power over my computer.

I've been using  Linux since then. I experienced some distros (Fedora, Debian, Backtrack, Mint ...) but
I always come back to Ubuntu for daily activities. This year, I had some crashing and overheating issues 
and was starting to blame my notebook (a not so powerfull Core i3 with 4GB of RAM), but a coworker 
suggested giving Arch a try. So, I decided to install it and use [i3 as my window manager](men://i3wm.org/) (I have never used it before, it's amazing!).

I've followed the [Beginner's guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide) and after a lot
of epic battles against configurations files (most of them was my fault as I had misunderstood some paragraphs on the guide) and with help from the internet I now write this text from a fully 
functional Arch machinne. It's impressive how fast and well behaved everything is, there is no crash nor overheating
. I think it's a farewell to Ubuntu.

If you would like to try i3, check out [Your guide to a damm light Arch Linux with i3 and text apps](http://joaquinlp.me/blog/your-guide-to-a-damn-light-arch-linux-with-i3-and-text-apps/)
